ðŸ“˜ **Dart Assignment: Student Grade Analyzer** 

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:**

Create a Dart program that collects subject names and grades from a student, calculates the average, and gives a final result. This assignment focuses on practicing:

âœ… Data Types, Null Safety, final, const  
  âœ… Functions  
  âœ… Control Flow Structures  
  âœ… Loops  
  âœ… Collections  
  âœ… stdin.readLineSync()

ðŸ§  **Your Task:**

Write a Dart program that:

1. Asks the student to enter their **name**.  
2. Asks how many **subjects** they are taking.  
3. For each subject:  
   * Ask for the **subject name**.  
   * Ask for the **grade**.  
4. Store the data in a **Map\<String, int\>** where:  
   * The **key** is the subject name.  
   * The **value** is the grade.  
5. Use a **function** to calculate the average.  
    Use **if/else** to determine if the student **passed**.  
6. Display the student name, all subject-grade pairs, average, and a final message.

ðŸ“Œ **Concept Requirements:**

| Concept | Must Include |
| :---- | :---- |
| Data Types | String, int, double, Map |
| Null Safety | Safe input handling |
| final & const | Use both correctly |
| Functions | At least one function (for average) |
| Control Flow | if/else |
| Loops | for loop to input subjects/grades |
| Collections | Use Map\<String, int\> |
| stdin.readLineSync() | For all user input |

ðŸ’¡ **Bonus (Optional):**

* Add performance levels:  
  * 90+ â†’ Excellent  
  * 80â€“89 â†’ Very Good  
  * 70â€“79 â†’ Good  
  * \<70 â†’ Needs Improvement  
* Validate that grade is between 0 and 100\.  
* Print the **highest** and **lowest** grade and subject.
